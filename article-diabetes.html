                            <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
                            <p>Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. When you eat, your body breaks down most of the food into glucose (sugar) and releases it into your bloodstream. When blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin, which acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy.</p>

                            <p>If you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn't enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, this can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.</p>

                            <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
                            
                            <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
                            <p>Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction where the body attacks itself by mistake. This reaction stops your body from making insulin. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to survive. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults, though it can develop at any age.</p>

                            <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
                            <p>With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't use insulin well and can't keep blood sugar at normal levels. Type 2 diabetes develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults, though more and more children, teens, and young adults are being diagnosed. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes.</p>

                            <h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
                            <p>Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born but increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in life.</p>

                            <div class="info-box">
                                <h4>📊 Did You Know?</h4>
                                <p>According to recent statistics, approximately 537 million adults worldwide are living with diabetes. This number is expected to rise to 643 million by 2030 if current trends continue.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
                            <p>Recognizing the symptoms of diabetes is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. Common symptoms include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Increased thirst and urination</li>
                                <li>Extreme hunger</li>
                                <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
                                <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                                <li>Blurred vision</li>
                                <li>Slow-healing sores or frequent infections</li>
                                <li>Tingling or numbness in hands or feet</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
                            <p>Several factors can increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Being overweight or obese is a primary risk factor</li>
                                <li><strong>Inactivity:</strong> The less active you are, the greater your risk</li>
                                <li><strong>Family history:</strong> Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes</li>
                                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 45</li>
                                <li><strong>Gestational diabetes:</strong> If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant</li>
                                <li><strong>Polycystic ovary syndrome:</strong> Having PCOS increases the risk of diabetes</li>
                            </ul>

                                <h2>Prevention Strategies</h2>
                                <p>While type 1 diabetes can't be prevented, type 2 diabetes can often be prevented or delayed through lifestyle changes:</p>

                                <h3>1. Maintain a Healthy Weight</h3>
                                <p>Losing even 5% to 7% of your body weight can significantly reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Focus on long-term changes to your eating and exercise habits rather than short-term solutions.</p>

                                <h3>2. Be More Physically Active</h3>
                                <p>Regular physical activity has many benefits, including helping you lose weight, lowering your blood sugar, and boosting your sensitivity to insulin. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week.</p>

                                <h3>3. Eat Healthy Foods</h3>
                                <p>Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Strive for variety in your diet to help you achieve your goals without compromising taste or nutrition.</p>

                                <h3>4. Skip Fad Diets</h3>
                                <p>Many fad diets may help you lose weight initially, but their effectiveness at preventing diabetes isn't known, nor are their long-term effects. Instead, make healthy eating a permanent part of your lifestyle.</p>

                                <h2>Management and Treatment</h2>
                                <p>Managing diabetes involves several key strategies:</p>

                                <h3>Blood Sugar Monitoring</h3>
                                <p>Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels is essential for managing diabetes. Your healthcare provider will recommend how often you should check your blood sugar levels based on your treatment plan.</p>

                                <h3>Medication</h3>
                                <p>Depending on the type of diabetes, various medications may be prescribed, including insulin and oral medications that help your body use insulin more effectively or produce more insulin.</p>

                                <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
                                <p>Working with a registered dietitian to create a meal plan is crucial. A diabetes meal plan focuses on eating healthy foods in moderate amounts and sticking to regular mealtimes.</p>

                                <h3>Regular Exercise</h3>
                                <p>Physical activity is an important part of diabetes management. Exercise helps your body use insulin more efficiently, lowering blood sugar levels, and helps with weight management.</p>

                                <div class="warning-box">
                                    <h4>⚠️ Important Note</h4>

                                <h2>Living Well with Diabetes</h2>
                                <p>With proper management, people with diabetes can lead full, active lives. The key is to:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Follow your treatment plan consistently</li>
                                    <li>Keep regular appointments with your healthcare team</li>
                                    <li>Stay educated about new developments in diabetes care</li>
                                    <li>Connect with support groups and other people living with diabetes</li>
                                    <li>Take care of your mental health as well as your physical health</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>Understanding diabetes is the first step in prevention and effective management. Whether you're at risk for diabetes, have been recently diagnosed, or have been living with diabetes for years, knowledge is power. By making healthy lifestyle choices, working closely with your healthcare team, and staying committed to your management plan, you can live a healthy, fulfilling life.</p>

                                <p>Remember, diabetes management is a journey, not a destination. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your successes, and don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it.</p>
